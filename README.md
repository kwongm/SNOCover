- 👋 Hi, I’m @kwongm
- 👀 I’m interested in healthcare-related data science/algorithms for SNOMED CT analysis and EKG data analysis. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about NLP algorithms for parsing clinical raw text data and building NLP pipelines to map to SNOMED CT concept terms. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Clinical care data analysis, NLP algorithms and any interesting topic I hear about!
